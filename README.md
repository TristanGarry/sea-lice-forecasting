# sea-lice-forecasting

## Tristan Garry's code accompanying his EEB498 undergraduate honours thesis - It's raining sea lice: forecasting sea lice occurence in juvenile wild salmon

The aim of this project is to accurately forecast within-season occurence of sea lice on wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. 

This project aims to use deep learning methods to bring together data including wild salmon parasite counts, temperature data, and farmed salmon data.

Please refer all questions to me at tristan.garry@mail.utoronto.ca

## Using the code

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/TristanGarry/sea-lice-forecasting/wiki) if you want a guide on getting up and running on using the code in this repo. 

## Supervisors

This project consists of the modelling portion my honours thesis at the University of Toronto. The research is supervised by [Martin Krkošek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/), Canada Research Chair in Population Ecology; and [Marie-Josée Fortin](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca/), Canada Research Chair in Spatial Ecology.
