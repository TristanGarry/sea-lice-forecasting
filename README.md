## Using the code

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/TristanGarry/sea-lice-forecasting/wiki) if you want a guide on getting up and running on using the code in this repo. 

## Supervisors

This project consists of the modelling portion my honours thesis at the University of Toronto. The research is supervised by [Martin Krkošek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/), Canada Research Chair in Population Ecology; and [Marie-Josée Fortin](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca/), Canada Research Chair in Spatial Ecology. 

## Work to do

If you're looking for which work is being queued up, check out the [projects](https://github.com/TristanGarry/sea-lice-forecasting/projects/1) or [issues](https://github.com/TristanGarry/sea-lice-forecasting/issues) tabs.

As of March 2020, all modelling work is finished and remaining work will be focused on the presentation and discussion of results.
