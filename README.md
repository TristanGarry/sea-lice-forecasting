# sea-lice-forecasting

## Tristan Garry's code accompanying his EEB498 undergraduate honours thesis - It's raining sea lice: forecasting sea lice occurence in juvenile wild salmon

The aim of this project is to accurately forecast within-season occurence of sea lice on wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. 

This project aims to use deep learning methods to bring together data including wild salmon parasite counts, temperature data, and farmed salmon data.
